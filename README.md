# Project Repository

## Overview

This repository contains only a subset of the project's files this is because Git/GitHub **CANNOT handle large files even with Git LFS**. There is **nothing** we can do about this on our part.

## Plastic SCM

We are using Plastic SCM for version control, which is better equipped for managing large game assets. Unfortunately, Plastic SCM does not allow for public sharing of repositories

Thank you for understanding!
